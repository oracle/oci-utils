# oci-utils.oci-image-migrate

## Introduction

oci-image-migrate prepares the image of an on-premise vm for being migrate to
 the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. The code detects the image type, the 
 operating system as well as various configurations with respect to network, 
 partitions, file systems, mount setup
... 
 The code is flexible and open for addition 
 of new operating systems, new image type, new configurations.

## Usage


    # oci-image-migrate --help
    usage: oci-image-migrate [-i INPUTIMAGE] [-b BUCKETNAME] [-o OUTPUTIMAGE]
                             [--verbose] [--help]

    Utility to support preparation of on-premise legacy images for importing in
    the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

    optional arguments:
      -i INPUTIMAGE, --input-mage INPUTIMAGE
                            The on-premise image for migration to OCI.
      -b BUCKETNAME, --bucket BUCKETNAME
                            The destination bucket in OCI to store the converted
                            image.
      -o OUTPUTIMAGE, --output-image OUTPUTIMAGE
                            The output image name.
      -v, --verbose         Show verbose information.
      --help                Display this help`

The environment variable _OCI_UTILS_DEBUG changes the logging level of
the python code.
 
## The image type

The image type specific code has

1. a dictionary **format_data** containing 1 key, the **magic number**
   and a value which contains the dictionary of mandatory and optional
   data. Mandatory are the **name**, the **module** name, the **class**
   name. The **prereq** key is also optional and its value is structure
   of image type prerequisites.

    format_data = {'01234567': {'name': 'sometype',
                                'module': 'sometype',
                                'clazz': 'SomeTypeHead',
                                'prereq': {'MAX_IMG_SIZE_GB': 300.0}}}
                           
1. a class definition **SomeTypeHead**,  which is a child of the 
**DeviceData** class, contains a structure defining the header of the image 
file, which has methods:
   1. **show_header** to display the header data;
   1. **image_size** to return a dictionary containig the physical and 
   logical size for the image file in GigaBytes;
   1. **image_supported** to test if the image is suppored;
   1. **type_specific_prereq_test** to verify the image type specific 
   prerequisites;
   1. **image_data** which collects the data for this image type;

## The operating system dependent code

The code which is dependent of the operating system type, i.e. Oracle Linux 
type or Ubuntu Linux type distributions currently.

1. the tag **\_os_type_tag_csl_tag_type_os_** which is a list of operating 
system ID's as they are presented in the **os-release** file;
1. the method **install_cloud_init** which installs  the cloud_init and its 
dependent packages;
1. the method **update_network_config** to modify the network configuration 
as required by the migration documentation;


## The data structure

The **DeviceData** class creates, completes and uses a dictionary 
datastructure **img_info** for analysing the image:

    img_name   <image file name>

    img_type   [VMDK | qcow2]

    img_header <contents is type dependent>

    img_size  physical
