.B ] [-y|--yes] [-v|--verbose] [--help]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The

.PP
Verifies if the conditions for import of the image file /data/images/Ubuntu1804.qcow2
in the
.B Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
are met, updates the network configuration, installs the cloud-init package,

.SH KNOWN ISSUES

.IP \[bu] 2 "The cloud-init service does not start at first boot in OCI."
The cloud-init service, although enabled does not start at first boot in
OCI. This was noticed on ubuntu18 server and is probably related to
the situation described in https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1669675.
The workaround:
.nr step 1 1
.RS
.IP \n[step]
connect to the instance using vnc or serial console.
.IP \n+[step]
delete the contents of /var/lib/cloud.
.IP \n+[step]
eventually delete /var/log/cloud* files.
.IP \n+[step]
explicitly start the cloud-init service.
.IP \n+[step]
reboot the instance.
.IP \[bu]
or run the script
.B /usr/local/bin/reinitialise_cloud_init.sh and reboot.
.RE
.IP \[bu] "/dev/disk/by-id entries in /etc/fstab are not supported."
Entries in /etc/fstab as /dev/disk/by-id are not supported yet.
The workaround:
.RS
.IP \[bu]
update the /etc/fstab file so it refers to partitions via label, uuid, logical volume.
.RE
.IP \[bu] "The instance fails to find boot disk."
The instance created from a migrated image does not boot, is unable to find boot disk because
.B initramfs
does not include the correct kernel module to recognise the bootable partition. The issue
is being worked on.
The workaround:
.RS
.IP \[bu]
Rebuild initramfs before migration so it includes all modules and
rebuilding again after first boot with the necessary ones.
