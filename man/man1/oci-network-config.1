.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.B oci-network-config
utility shows the current
Virtual interface Cards provisioned in the
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
and configured on this instance. When a secondary VNIC is provisioned in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure it must be explicitly configured on the instance using this script or similar commands.

By default this command displays the currently provisioned VNICs and the current IP configuration for this instance. VNICs that are not yet configured are marked with '$ADD' and IP configurations that no longer have an associated VNIC are marked with '$DELETE'.

Using the 
.B configure
sub-command, it configures VNICs that do not have an IP configuration and deletes the IP configurations of VNICs that are not currently provisioned. This puts the instance IP configuration in sync with current Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provisioning.

The configuring interfaces can optionally be placed inside separate network namespaces. This is necessary when VNICs are in subnets (different VCNs) with overlapping address blocks and the network applications are not bound directly to interfaces. Network namespaces require applications to be launched in them explicitly (via 'ip netns exec <ns>') in order to establish association with the interface. When namespaces are not used, policy-based routing is configured to provide a default route to the secondary VNIC\'s virtual router (default gateway) when the VNIC\'s address is the source address.

Bare Metal secondary VNICs are configured using VLANs (where there is no corresponding physical interface). These will look like 2 addition interfaces when showing IP links, with names like '$MACVLAN_FORMAT' for the MAC VLAN and '$VLAN_FORMAT' for the IP VLAN.

Using the
.B unconfigure
sub-command, it deletes all IP configuration for provisioned secondary VNICs.

The
.B attach-vnic
and
.B detach-vnic
sub-commands allows creating a new VNIC for the instance, detaching a VNIC from the instance,
or adding/removing private IP addresses to/from an existing VNIC.

The
.B add-secondary-addrc
and
.B remove-secondary-addr
sub-commands allows adding/removing private IP addresses to/from an existing VNIC.



To install the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Python SDK, use
.PP
.nf
.RS
yum install python36-oci-sdk python-oci-cli
.RE
.fi
.PP
The python-oci-cli package contains the oci command line utility.  You can
use the oci utility for configuring the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Python SDK:
.PP
.nf
.RS
oci setup config
.RE
.fi
.PP
See https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm
for more information.

Another option for authorizing the use of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services from an instance is
using Instance Principals.  The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure SDK does not need configuration on the
instance when the instance is part of a dynamic group that was granted access
to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services.  See https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Tasks/callingservicesfrominstances.htm for further details.

When
.BR ocid(8)
is enabled, it runs this utility each time the VNIC configuration metadata of the instance changes.  It also restores the VNIC configuration after rebooting the system.  If
.BR ocid(8)
is not enabled this script must be run periodically to pick up changes in VNIC provisioning (whether adding or deleting). Note that these IP configuration changes are not persistent, the script must, at a minimum, be run on each startup.

To exclude VNICs, IP addresses or VLAN interfaces from automatic configuration use the -X (or --exclude) option.  Exclusions specified with this option are persistent so that they also apply when
.BR ocid(8)
runs this utility.  The exclusion remains in place until the VNIC/address/interface is re-included using the -I (or --include) option.
